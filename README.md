## OCR

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that allows a computer to recognize text or characters from images or scanned documents and convert it into machine-readable text. OCR software can analyze the shapes, patterns, and arrangement of characters in an image and extract the text information for further processing, such as storing, editing, or analyzing.

OCR has a wide range of applications, including digitization of printed documents, automated data entry, text recognition in images, text extraction from invoices, receipts, and forms, document indexing and retrieval, and more. OCR technology is widely used in industries such as finance, healthcare, logistics, legal, and administrative tasks where large amounts of text data need to be processed efficiently and accurately.

OCR can be performed using various techniques, such as pattern recognition, machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and computer vision. OCR software can handle different types of fonts, languages, and document layouts, but its accuracy may vary depending on the quality of the image, the complexity of the text, and other factors. Advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have greatly improved the accuracy and performance of OCR systems in recent years, making it a valuable tool for text recognition and data extraction tasks.

## OCR_APP

This is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name,designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, pincode. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application'sgraphical user interface (GUI).
The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a database(MySQL) along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.]
The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button.
The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management.
Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals who need to manage business card information efficiently.
